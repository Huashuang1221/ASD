# ASD
To characterize alterations in cortical thickness-based MBNs among adolescent males with ASD and to test whether these network changes spatially correspond to normative PET-derived neurotransmitter receptor/transporter maps

# dataset
The participants were obtained from Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) datasets (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/)

# AnalysisSteps.m
AnalysisSteps.m is aimed to calculate the node properties and the correlation coefficient. This code requires the GRETNA toolbox.


# across family correction
Given the multi-level nature of the analyses, cross-level correction for multiple comparisons is required

# To perform linear mixed-effects modeling (LMM), you can use the code in the LMM_code folder.

# step2_corr_trans.m is used to calculate JUSPACE .

# The scripts for reproducibility analysis are provided in the reproducibility directory.

# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_code
We explored the association between ADOS scores and (1) the connectivity edges linked to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and (2) the nodal degree centrality of the OFC.
